In order to be great at something, you have to do it a thousand times. This was the advice [Rasmus Andersson](https://moonwith.com/posts/rsms), an industry titan and personal hero gave me. With this advice in mind, I decided to rebuild my [personal platform](https://moonwith.com/) from scratch for the sixth time. Now, with knowledge I didn't have and technology that was not available two years ago.

Since good software takes time to build, Wondernest is an experimental playground and a blog within a blog. **If you asked me for more content related with my personal experience on building, designing and improving products and enabling teams, this is for you.** Occasionaly, I'll share insights and highlights from my research on how social psychology can be applied in the development of technology.

This site is already using [the new app router from Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), as well as [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to serve the content. It will be fun to explore more ways of interacting with you and figuring out what a platform built in 2023 can be.
